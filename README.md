# 📊 Dylan Boateng - Data Analyst Portfolio

## Overview
I recently graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, database management, and systems analysis—skills I’ve applied to real-world projects in cybersecurity and business systems.

I thrive in collaborative environments where problem-solving, innovation, and continuous learning drive success. My experience includes working with tools like SQL, Python, Microsoft Access, and Excel, as well as building user-friendly systems that streamline operations and improve decision-making.

I’m passionate about using technology to solve business problems and eager to contribute to a team that values growth, integrity, and forward thinking.

This is a repository where I showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
